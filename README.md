# A Binary de Bruijn Sequence Generator from Product of Irreducible Polynomials
*by Martianus Frederic Ezerman and Adamas Aqsa Fahreza*

This is a basic software implementation that generate binary de Bruijn sequences from products of irreducible polynomials.

## Introduction

### Technical reference
This is a basic implementation of the procedures proposed in the preprint

> Z. Chang, M. F. Ezerman, S. Ling, and H. Wang, “On binary de Bruijn sequences from LFSRs with arbitrary characteristic polynomials.” Available at (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.10088v2).

## Ingredients and procedures
This software requires `Python 2.7` and depends on the `sympy` library, which can be obtained [here](http://www.sympy.org/en/download.html).
The file `debr_example.py` goes through all features and shows how this module can be used.
